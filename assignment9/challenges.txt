I had many challenges with this assignment. I had to resort to slowing down and going step by step with a million print statements
and reruns of the code to incrementally get through it. The other thing I did was talk through the code outloud with my partner
when I was having trouble writing the parent/child loop of Task 6 and that immediately helped me figure out what to do to fix it.
